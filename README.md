# 📊 Multi-Stock Price Prediction & Forecasting Platform

An end-to-end machine learning system for predicting short-term and long-term price movements of Nifty 50 stocks using deep learning and time-series forecasting techniques.

🔗 **Live Demo:** _Add Hugging Face Link Here_  
🧠 **Models Used:** LSTM • Prophet • Random Forest • ARIMA  
☁️ **Deployment:** Streamlit + Hugging Face Spaces

## 📌 Project Description

This project builds a comprehensive multi-stock forecasting framework designed to analyze and predict stock price behavior using historical market data from 2010 to 2025.

The system integrates:

- **LSTM** for short-term next-day prediction  
- **Prophet** for long-term trend forecasting  
- **Random Forest** for feature-based regression  
- **ARIMA** as a statistical benchmark  

Unlike single-model stock prediction projects, this system performs comparative model analysis and deploys the most effective approaches in a real-time web application.

The final platform enables:

- 📈 Short-term price forecasting  
- 📊 Long-term trend projection  
- 📉 Model performance comparison  
- 🌐 Interactive cloud deployment

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
Historical stock price data is collected using the `yfinance` library for Nifty 50 stocks (2010–2025).

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning & validation  
- Datetime conversion  
- Sorting by stock & date  
- Missing value handling  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
Technical indicators generated:

- SMA (20 & 50 day)
- RSI (14 day)
- Rolling Volatility (20 day)
- Daily Returns

### 4️⃣ Model Training

**LSTM (Short-Term Forecasting)**
- 60-day lookback window
- Stacked LSTM layers
- MinMax scaling
- Best performing model

**Prophet (Long-Term Forecasting)**
- Yearly seasonality
- Trend decomposition
- Multiplicative seasonality mode

**Random Forest**
- Ensemble regression model
- Uses engineered technical indicators

**ARIMA**
- Stationarity enforced via ADF test
- Linear statistical baseline

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | RMSE | MAE |
|--------|------|------|
| LSTM | 39.84 | 32.58 |
| Random Forest | 176.03 | 123.17 |
| ARIMA | 219.87 | 169.87 |

LSTM significantly outperformed classical statistical models for short-term forecasting.

## 🚀 Deployment

- Models are serialized after training
- Loaded dynamically in Streamlit app
- User selects stock and forecast type
- Predictions generated in real time
- Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces

This demonstrates a complete machine learning lifecycle from data engineering to production deployment.

## ⚠ Limitations

- Uses historical price data only
- No sentiment or macroeconomic signals
- No real-time streaming integration
- Not an automated trading system

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integrate financial news sentiment analysis
- Add macroeconomic indicators
- Implement portfolio optimization
- Enable real-time data streaming
- Explore reinforcement learning trading models
